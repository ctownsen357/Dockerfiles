# Dockerfiles
My collection of Dockerfiles.  The intent is to make them easy to understand and allow one to get up and running quickly.  
I'm often on tight time constraints and need to get a project done quickly.  
I've come across many Dockerfile projects that look slick as can be and include every option possible as an argument or 
variable that can be set.  After I start digging in I realize that I'm basically learning someone's custom framework around Docker and all I really wanted was a simple base to work from. 

This repo is intented to be a collection of minimal examples to get the target functionality up and running as quickly as 
possible so that I can get my work done and move on.  Sometimes it involves hackiness that isn't pretty.
