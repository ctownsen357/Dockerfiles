# Dockerfiles
My collection of Dockerfiles that are easy to understand and one may get up and running quickly.  
I'm often on tight time constraints and need to get a project done quickly.  
I've come across many Dockerfile projects that look slick as can be and include every option possible as an argument or 
variable that can be set.  After I start digging in I realize that I'm basically learning someone's custom framework around Docker.

This repo is intented to be a collection of bare minimum examples to get the target functionality up and running as quickly as 
possible so that I can get my work done and move on.  Sometimes it involves hackiness that isn't pretty.
